# Libft
Your very first own library

Summary:
This project is about coding a C library.
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

Version: 16

Introduction
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library.

NOTE:
Some of the functions’ prototypes you have to redo use the ’restrict’
qualifier. This keyword is part of the c99 standard. It is therefore not included 
in the prototypes and to compile the code with the -std=c99 flag.
